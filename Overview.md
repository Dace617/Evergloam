# Overview

This list is designed around the basic premise of ForgottenGlory's Path of the Dovahkiin Modlist

The tenets I would like to uphold are as follows:

* A coherent experience based around adventuring and defeating enemies
* A heavy focus on character customization and play style variation - This may be toned down depending on balance concerns
* Extreme enemy variety
* Insane amounts of loot


## The Combat

At time of writing the comabt will be based around Inpa Sekiro Combat as I feel this will add a significant challenge to enemies and introduce some tactical gameplay beyond "Large numbers = better". Dodging will be implemented via TK Dodge Re.

A large suite of Magic mods will be implemented where possible to give a large choice of spells to use.


## The Enemies

Enmemy variety will be at the forefront of mod chocies for this list. Path of the Dovahkiin was already quite functional in this regard, but I would like to increase the variety as much as possible as well as make almost every playthrough as different as possible.

At time of writing the large scale plan will be to implement fairly custom Encounter zones through the entire game and have a large variety of enemies that can show in ANY area of the game at any given point. 

The aim will be to have various "classes" of enemies that can appear in a given area of the map for example the area around whiterun may contain anything from Bandits to Skeletons to Deadroth and will be different every time you pass through an area.

Enemies should be unleveled but have a strict range their levels can be. and stronger enemies should appear as the player levels to keep the challenge consistent but at the same time give the player places where they can reliably gain strength should they need to.

Wenches. Enough said.

Difficulty will be increased a lot, The ideal should be you will *NEED* the power that Vokriinator Black will give you.

## The Loot

Halgari's RPG Loot will return for this list. Enmchantments will ideally be much rarer however, and more difficult to aquire, with only 1-2 pieces of enchanted or usable gear dropping from a given enemy.
Additional enchantments will be added if possible and the existing enchantments will be filtered very strictly to remove as many "useless" enchantments as possible.

The end goal for armours included in the list should be "More armours than you can count." 

## The Slight NSFW

Tastefully Skimpy. Revealing armours where possible as well as options for those that would like more "protection" in their armours

## A reason to explore

Hidden items everywhere possible. hand placed if need be. while random loot is the end goal, Reasons must be given for exploring the vast dungeons given in the list. Skyshards will be used to encourage tackling stroger and stronger dungeons. Unique looking/powerful loot will be placed in other less frequented places.

## A reason to rest

Details to come, Gold is XP likely to return (with much steeper costs), economy vastly restricted. Player crafting used for unique armours not on the random drop table.

Buffs to resting in town? well rested buff perhaps?
